## Plastic Tracker CoCo 2024 Hackathon

Did you know that there are 5.25 trillion tons of plastic in the ocean?
That's a lot isn't it?
Every year, 100 million marine animals die from plastic waste, and how the plastic ended up there is unpredictable to us.
That's why for this year's ESF Computer Conference, we decided to create a Plastic Waste tracker, specifically for waste disposed out of Hong Kong.

This is a plastic tracker simulation which allows you to simulate where trash ends up.

The way the algorithm calculates the predicted path is through data provided by the [Hong Kong government]([url](https://current.hydro.gov.hk/main/prediction_static.php)) and doing trigonometric calculations based on the bearing and current.

The plastic tracker website also includes a slider, allowing you to see where the plastic ends up after a certain amount of days.

Only bounded and exclusive within Hong Kong due to lack of global current data.
